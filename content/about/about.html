# Programming

I have experience working boths as System Engineer and
as a Software Engineer. Talking about software, my
OS of choice is [FreeBSD][], though I use Linux as well.
As for programming languages, I like C and Python, 
trying to understand if I like C++ and have to deal with
Java time to time.

I like Open Source and try to contribute to existing
projects and share projects of my own, check out 
[projects][] page for details.
