# Own projects

## Actual

### cdf

[cdf][] is a *c*olorful *df*, written in C with help of
_Pierre Chifflier_. I haven't updated for a long time,
but it works fine still.

List of projects I've used to contribute to:

### Torsmo and Conky

I've first seen [Torsmo][] back in 2004. It only supported Linux and I decided
to create a port for FreeBSD. I had to re-implement all the monitoring stuff
for FreeBSD. At that time torsmo was not supported by its maintainers already,
so I just kept all the patches in the port.

Later on [Torsmo][] was finally forked, new project was called [Conky][]. I 
happened to get a commit access and imported all my patches. For few years
I've been supporting FreeBSD specific features, did a basic bugfixing, added
some new features. At some point I changed the way I work with my computer
and stopped using conky, therefore stopped supporting conky and passed
maintainership to other person.

### PearPC

[PearPC][] is a PowerPC emulator, a very interesting project. I've been only
improving portability of GNU autotools based build system. Unfortunately,
the project doesn't seem to be active anymore.
